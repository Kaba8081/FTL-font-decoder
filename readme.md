# FTL font decoder

This tool allows decoding .font file format inside game files from [FTL: Faster Than Light](https://subsetgames.com/ftl.html).

Inside the project files is also a [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex) pattern file for better understanding about this format. ([ftl_font](https://github.com/D-side/ftl_font) is another project which documented the .font format well).

## Usage

1. Download the [Slipstream Mod Manager](https://github.com/Vhati/Slipstream-Mod-Manager) and upack the 'ftl.dat' file inside the game's directory. After that copy desired .font files or the whole 'fonts/' folder into this project's directory.
